    <div class="About_me">
    <p><h2>About Seiya Miyazaki</h2>Seiya began his career with a bachelor's in History from the University of Florida with the intent to enter Law School. As the time arrived to pick a school to attend, Seiya instead decided to take off and travel. Seiya spent a year backpacking across Australia, where he chased Kangaroos, surfed Bondi beach and snorkeled the Great Barrier Reef. From there, Seiya traveled to the South Pacific, spending 3 months in the remote village of Labukulila in the Solomon Islands building schoolhouses and teaching English Language courses in exchange for spear fishing lessons and a place to stay. Upon returning to the states, Seiya entered the Masters of Science in Education program at the University of Bridgeport to pursue his newfound desire to teach. Upon completion of that program, Seiya took a job in Seoul, South Korea teaching English Language Subjects at a boarding school for international students. Seiya was also in charge of the dormitory itself, overseeing the lives and safety of 35 kids between the ages of 13 and 17. After the birth of his son, Seiya returned to the states again to begin a career as a public school educator. Initially Seiya taught at Park Trails Elementary school in Parkland, Florida but after a couple years he moved again to Greenport, NY, way out on the East End of Long Island. There he joined a small medical startup company, developing it from a team of 7 people overseeing 600 patients, squished into a 350 square foot office to a team of 35 people oversing 3,500 patients from 4 medical offices across Long Island and upstate New York. Seiya is currently an Operations Manager for a branch of SRS Distributions and spends his free time playing Dungeons and Dragons with his kids, stand up paddleboarding the Peconic Bay or playing another game of "why won't you work?" with his Jeep.</p> </div>
